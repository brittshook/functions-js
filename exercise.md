# ALAB 308.5.1: Creating Reusable Functions

## Part 1: Thinking Functionally
To me, the second function makes the most sense: 
```function reverseString2(str) {
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}```

This code is short, readable, and efficient. The methods used, in addition to the function name, help understand what is happening in the code. I also considered one of the recursive options, however it is not as readable and is less efficient in terms of time complexity.
